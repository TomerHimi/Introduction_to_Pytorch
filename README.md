# Introduction_to_Pytorch

This is my implementation with CUCUMBER AN OrSN COMPANY of variety of Fully-Connected Neural Networks using Pytorch package as part of an exercise 4 for Machine Learning course 89511 at Bar Ilan University.

It has to be mentioned that train_x data is missing in this github, due to file size restrictions.
